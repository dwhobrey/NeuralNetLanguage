DESCRIPTION        
        cpp  is  a  stand-alone  C preprocessor, intended for use with C
        compilers  such  as  HSC  which  do  not  provided   access   to
        preprocessor output.  It implements translation phases 1 through
        4  as  specified  by  the  standards document ANSI/ISO 9899-1990
        describing the  C  programming  language,  including  trigraphs,
        token pasting and stringizing.

        cpp optionally  accepts  two filenames as arguments.  input-file
        and output-file are, respectively, the input  and  output  files
        for the  preprocessor.    If  not specified, or if given as `-',
        they default to the standard  input  and  the  standard  output,
        respectively.

OPTIONS        
        -C
                Pass  all  comments  (except  those  that appear on  cpp
                directive lines) through the preprocessor.  By  default,
                cpp strips out C-style comments.

        -P[012]
                Preprocess  the input without producing the line control
                information used by the next pass of the C compiler.   A
                numeric  argument  can be passed to -P: 0 specifies that
                no line control information control is generated, and is
                equivalent to -P; 1 specifies that normal  line  control
                information  is  generated,  which is the default; and 2
                specifies that line control information is generated  in
                the form of preprocessor  #line directives.

        -T
                Translate trigraphs in the input file.  This behavior is
                implied by the -ansi option.

        -D name
                Define  name  as  1  (one).    This  is the same as if a
                -Dname=1 option appeared on the  cpp command line, or as
                if a
                #define name 1
                line  appeared  in  the  source  file  that     cpp   is
                processing.

        -Dname=def
                Define name  as  if by a #define directive.  This is the
                same as if a
                #define name def
                line  appeared  in  the  source  file  that     cpp   is
                processing.  The -D option has lower precedence than the
                -U  option;  that is, if the same name is used in both a
                -U option and a -D option, the name  will  be  undefined
                regardless of the order of the options.

        -Idirectory
                Insert    directory  into  the  search path for #include
                files with names not beginning with "/", "\", or a drive
                specifier.  directory is inserted ahead of the  standard
                list of  "include"  directories.  Thus, #include files
                with names enclosed in double-quotes  (")  are  searched
                for first in the directory of the file with the #include
                line,  then  in  directories  named with -I options, and
                lastly, in directories from  the  standard  list.    For
                #include  files  with  names  enclosed in angle-brackets
                (<>), the directory of the file with the  #include  line
                is not  searched.   See USAGE below for exact details of
                this search order.

        -S[filename]
                Specify an alternate configuration file.  If filename is
                present, the specified  file  is  read  instead  of  the
                default  configuration  file; if filename is absent, the
                default configuration file is  simply  not  read.    See
                USAGE below for further details.

        -Uname
                Remove  any  initial definition of name, where name is a
                symbol that is predefined by the preprocessor.

        -V
                Print version information to stderr.

        -ansi
                Define the preprocessor token __STDC__ to have value  1,
                and enable   trigraph  translation.    To  get  __STDC__
                without  trigraph  translation,  you  can  specify   the
                options -ansi -T.

        -pedantic
                Issue  warnings  for  constructs which, while recognized
                and accepted by most  preprocessors,  are  not  strictly
                allowed by   the   ANSI/ISO  standard.    Currently  the
                following such constructs are recognized:
                *  Numeric  tokens  which  fall   afoul   of   the   new
                `preprocessing  number'  definition  in  ANSI/ISO 6.1.8,
                such as `0x123e+1'. With or without -pedantic, cpp  will
                immediately   retokenize  the  offending  token  in  the
                expected manner.

        The following -f and -W options can be negated by adding  a  no-
        before the option name.  Some are on by default.

        -fc++-comments
                Support the C++ comment indicator "//". With this option
                active,  everything  on the line after the // is treated
                as a comment.  Off by default.

        -fimplicit-newlines
                Allow string literals to have embedded newlines,  as  in
                the following example:
                    "this is an
                     example"
                This  option  allows  cpp to be used on code written for
                certain rather irritatingly  nonstandard  compilers  (we
                won't mention GCC's name...).  Off by default.

        -Wbad-chars
                Issue  a  warning  if  a  character  that cannot legally
                appear in a C program appears  in  the  input.    On  by
                default.

        -Wnested-comments
                Issue  a  warning  if a comment-start character sequence
                ("/*", and "//" if -fc++-comments is active) appears  in
                a comment.  Off by default.

        -Wbad-concat-tokens
                Issue  a  warning if the token concatenation operator ##
                produces an illegal C token.  On by default.

        -Wunknown-pragma
                Issue  a  warning  if  the  input  contains  a   #pragma
                directive that cpp does not recognize.  Off by default.

        Options  beginning with -X are for specialized interactions with
        particular programs,  and  should    not  generally  be  invoked
        directly by  the user.  The following such options are currently
        recognized:

        -Xfluff
                This  option  is  used  by  the  fluff(1)  source   code
                checker.   It causes the preprocessor token __FLUFF__ to
                be defined, and enables certain related  pragmas.    See
                the fluff(1) documentation for further information.

USAGE        
        If  you  are  familiar with C, you should already know about the
        basic  workings  of  cpp.  We  will  not  go  into  a   detailed
        description  here,  since  any  good  book on C could do better;
        instead,  we  will   describe   details   particular   to   this
        implementation.

        Directory Search Order        
        A  file  specified in an #include directive will be searched for
        in the following directories, in order:
        1.
                The directory of the file that contains  the    #include
                directive,  if  the  directive  is of the form `#include
                "filename"'.
        2.
                The directories specified by -I options,  in  the  order
                they were specified.
        3.
                The   list  of  directories  specified  in  the  INCLUDE
                environment variable, in order.

        Special Names        
        The following macros are predefined by cpp:
        __STDC__
                Expands to 1 if the -ansi option is specified.
        __LINE__
                Expands to an integer constant representing the  current
                line number in the current input file.
        __FILE__
                Expands  to  a  string constant representing the name of
                the current input file.
        __DATE__
                Expands to a string constant of the form "Mmm  dd  yyyy"
                representing   the   date  on  which  preprocessing  was
                initiated.
        __TIME__
                Expands to a string  constant  of  the  form  "hh:mm:ss"
                representing  the system time at which preprocessing was
                initiated.

        Configuration files        
        cpp uses a configuration file to set up site-specific predefined
        macros.  By  default,  the  directories  specified  in  the  LIB
        environment   variable  are  searched  in  order  for  the  file
        cpp_defs.h; an alternate file can be specified from the  command
        line with the -S option.

        The  configuration  file  is read just like a normal input file,
        except that text  other  than  preprocessor  directives  is  not
        passed through  to  the output file.  Normally the configuration
        file will contain only comments and preprocessor directives.  In
        addition,  two  special  pragmas  are  recognized   within   the
        configuration file only:

        #pragma CPP_cmdline_arg option
                The  single  token  option is processed as though it had
                appeared as a command-line option.  The  option  may  be
                undone  from  the  command  line,  except  as  indicated
                below.

        #pragma CPP_delayed
                Normally, the configuration  file  is  processed  before
                command-line   options   are  processed,  to  allow  the
                commands  therein  to  be  overridden  by   command-line
                options.   This  pragma  causes  the  command line to be
                processed before the remainder  of  the  file,  allowing
                conditional  setup  based  on  parameters  set  from the
                command line.    Note   that   macro   definitions   and
                command-line   specifications  made  after  this  pragma
                cannot be undone from the command line.

        For example, the  following  configuration  file  activates  C++
        comments  by  default,  and sets the macro _PROTO() according to
        the presence of the -ansi option:
            #pragma CPP_cmdline_arg -fc++-comments
            #pragma CPP_delayed
            #ifdef __STDC__
            #  define _PROTO(x) x
            #else
            #  define _PROTO(x) ()
            #endif

DIAGNOSTICS        
        The  error  messages  produced  by  cpp  are  intended   to   be
        self-explanatory.   The line number and filename where the error
        occurred are printed along with the diagnostic.

BUGS        
        None that I know of, but there's almost always One More Bug(TM).
